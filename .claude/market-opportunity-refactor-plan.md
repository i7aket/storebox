# Market Opportunity Slide Refactoring Plan

## Task Overview
Refactor standalone "Market Opportunity" HTML slide to follow the existing StoreBox presentation structure and design approach.

## Problem Analysis
- **Provided**: Standalone HTML file with inline CSS/JS, Chart.js visualization, blue theme, Roboto font
- **Existing**: Multi-section presentation with external CSS/JS, CSS-based charts, green/dark theme, Ubuntu font
- **Goal**: Integrate content using existing presentation's modular approach

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Existing presentation has market opportunity section (#market) 
- ✅ Uses CSS variables for theming (--primary-green, --bg-dark, etc.)
- ✅ External style.css with comprehensive design system
- ✅ Custom CSS bar charts instead of Chart.js
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure with proper navigation

## Content Comparison
### Provided HTML Content:
- Chart.js visualization (Denmark 12.95, EU avg 2.5, Germany 0.47 m²/person)
- "Market undersaturated 5+ times" highlight
- +5.7% growth during 2008 crisis stat
- Detailed structural drivers with specific metrics
- Material Icons integration

### Existing Content:
- CSS bar chart comparison
- Housing area reduction data (72m² → 65m²)
- Mobile population stats (17%+ relocate annually)
- E-commerce growth (+57.8% Germany 2017-2020)
- Anti-crisis asset information
